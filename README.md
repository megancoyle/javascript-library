# javascript-library

JavaScript library that showcases different functionality that can be used on USGBC.org's website and microsites. The library utilizes several pieces of functionality from Bootstrap's JS, and incorporates elements that are useful for responsive design (i.e. tabs to accordion, stackable tables, and responsive images).

This library also contains CSS treatment of images (hover effects) and other elements that complement the JavaScript functionality.
