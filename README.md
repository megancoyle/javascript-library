JavaScript library that showcases different functionality that can be used on USGBC.org's website and microsites. The library utilizes several of Bootstrap's JS pieces of functionality, and incorporates elements that are useful for responsive design (i.e. tabs to accordion and stackable tables).

This library also contains CSS treatment of images and other elements that complement the JavaScript functionality.
